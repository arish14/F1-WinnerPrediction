# F1-Winner-Prediction

## Overview

Project F1 Winner Prediction is a data science project focused on predicting the winner of Formula 1 races using machine learning techniques. The project involves various stages such as data cleaning, data integration from multiple files, filtering, and implementing five different machine learning algorithms. The ultimate goal is to identify the best-performing algorithm and further enhance its performance.

## Project Workflow

The project follows a systematic workflow that includes the following steps:

1. **Data Cleaning:** The initial phase involves cleaning the raw data to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable format for analysis.

2. **Data Integration:** Multiple files containing relevant information are integrated to create a comprehensive dataset. This step is crucial for obtaining a holistic view of the data and enhancing the predictive capabilities of the model.

3. **Filtering:** The dataset is filtered to include only the relevant features and observations necessary for predicting Formula 1 race winners. This helps in reducing noise and improving the efficiency of the model.

4. **Data Modeling:** Five machine learning algorithms—K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), XG Boost, Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest—are implemented to build predictive models. Each algorithm is trained on the dataset to learn patterns and relationships.

5. **Model Evaluation:** The performance of each model is evaluated using appropriate metrics to assess their accuracy, precision, recall, and other relevant measures. This step is essential for comparing the effectiveness of different algorithms.

6. **Model Selection:** Based on the evaluation results, the XG Boost algorithm is selected as the best-performing model. This decision is crucial for further improvements and optimizations.

7. **Model Enhancement:** The XG Boost model is fine-tuned and optimized to achieve a final accuracy of 100%. This involves adjusting hyperparameters, feature engineering, robust scaler and other techniques to enhance the model's predictive capabilities.
